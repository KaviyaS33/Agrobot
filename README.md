# Agrobot
Agri-Path is a WebAR system for farmers to control robots by "drawing" paths on a phone screen over a live field feed. Using AR.js, Firebase, and NodeMCU, it converts gestures into 3D coordinates for the robot to follow. It eliminates complex coding and GPS, making high-tech farming accessible to all.
